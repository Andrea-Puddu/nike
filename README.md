## Description

NikeLand is a basic landing page clone that I crafted as part of a tutorial from a YouTube course to learn Tailwind CSS. As a junior web developer, this project allowed me to dive into the world of front-end development using React JS and master the art of styling with Tailwind CSS. NikeLand emulates the iconic Nike website's landing page, serving as a starting point for web development enthusiasts.
